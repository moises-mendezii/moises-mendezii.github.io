<h4>
  <p>For 86 years, Rikers Island has imprisoned up to about 15,000 prisoners a year since it opened in 1932. After several reports of horrible conditions and how their prisoners were being treated, Mayor de Blasio announced back in February, that the jail will finally be closed and smaller, safer jails will be opened in each borough around the city, except for Staten Island. </p>
  <p> A reporter for New York 1 revealed that the location for the four jails are:</p>
  <p>	Manhattan Detention Center, 125 White Street, Manhattan, 10013 </p>
  <p> Brooklyn Detention Center, 275 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, 11201 </p>
  <p> Queens Detention Center, 126-01 82nd Avenue, Kew Gardens, 11415 </p>
  <p> NYPD Tow Pound, 320 Concord Avenue, Bronx, 10454</p>

  <p> One of the Bronx’s most infamous jails: Spafford Juvenile Detention Center in Hunt’s Point finally closed its doors and demolition began in early November due to constant reports of its staff mistreating detainees and subpar living conditions. After the location for the Bronx jail was announced community members and activists to begin rallying against having the jail be built in their backyards.</p>

  <p> The city has heard their complaints and will continue to move forward with the construction of the jail. In a New York Times article, Councilwoman Diana Ayala, one of the major key players in the decision to add the jail in the Mott Haven neighborhood, stated she saw benefits to the new jail. </p>

  <blockquote>“I think it’s an opportunity to have the administration’s ear, and to reassess the way that we provide social services in the South Bronx,” she said.</blockquote>

  <p> But the community does not feel that way.</p>
